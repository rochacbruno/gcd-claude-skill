This page describes how to use API keys to access Google Cloud Dedicated in Germany APIs
and services that accept API keys.

Not all Google Cloud Dedicated in Germany APIs accept API keys to authorize usage. Review
the documentation for the service or API that you want to use to
determine whether it accepts API keys.

For information about creating and managing API keys, including restricting
API keys, see [Manage API keys](/docs/authentication/api-keys).

## Using an API key with REST

To include an API key with a REST API call, use the `x-goog-api-key` HTML
header.

If you can't use the HTTP header, you can use the `key` query parameter.
However, this method includes your API key in the URL, exposing your key
to URL scans.
